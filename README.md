virtuoso
========

This is a C++ program that integrates the Virtuoso Glove to create MIDI signals. It is currently only Windows compatible (sorry..). It utilizes the RtMidi library, WiiYourself library, as well as a Matlab program to graph the location of the gloves in real time. To run the program you will have to connect the Wiimote and Arudion on the glove to the computer via bluetooth, and then run the makefile in the rt-midi folder. The executable should open a new terminal window where the devices will connect and the process will start.
